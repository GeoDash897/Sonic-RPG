  ## History of Project (Overview)
I originally started this project back in early 2019 as my final project for my high school's Java 2 Gaming course. We were tasked with a game using the skills/concepts we learned throughout the school year. Being a Sonic fan, I decided to create 2D Sonic platformer similar to the original Sonic games on the [Sega Genesis](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sega_Mega_Drive_games), [Master System](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sega_Master_System_games), and [Game Gear](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Game_Gear_games). 

I started to develop the game in early March in my spare time (yeah, I started it before I was even *assigned* the project). 
This was the first project that I worked full time on (actually put time and effort into it). I was so dedicated to the project in fact that I worked on it during my lunch period instead of eating.

### Java 2 Final Project
Prior to programming the project, I was required to create a summary of the game and its components (story, game mechanics, etc). I pitched the game as being a crossover of [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog) and [Metal Slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Slug). Going into the project, I had a few goals I wanted to accomplish/implement: animations with multiple frames, system to store multiple levels, music system to play and change music, different kinds of enemies, a title screen, multiple characters, etc. I wanted to highlight some of the systems/code that I created:
